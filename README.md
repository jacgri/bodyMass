# Body-Mass Calculator

Using the calculation
```Body weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared (a.k.a metres height x metres height).```

Created two prompts: one that stores the user's weight, and another that stores the user's height and output the calculated BMI

This project was part of the MCRcodes course introducing Javascript and learning variables and conditional logic.
